# Comparative Analysis of Optical Flow Techniques: Classical Computer Vision vs Deep Learning Approach
CS 5330: Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision - Final Project Presentation : Spring 2023

Optical flow estimation has found applications in various computer vision applications like object detection and tracking, movement detection, robot navigation and visual odometry. 
This project presents a comprehensive study comparing the performance of both the classical and deep learning approaches for estimating dense  optical flow. We used the Farneback method as a representative of classical techniques and FlowNet2 as a representative of deep learning-based methods. 

Our experimental results highlight performance comparison of both the methods on a defined dataset using appropriate metrics - L1 error, Average end point error and Average angular error. The results show that FlowNet 2.0 provides significantly better results than Farneback Algorithm. 

This comparative analysis provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to adopt a suitable optical flow estimation technique for their specific applications.
